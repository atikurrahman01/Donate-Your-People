                <p>Community-driven development boasts many islands of success, but these have not scaled up to cover
                    entire countries.
                    Binswanger and Aiyar examine the possible obstacles to scaling up, and possible solutions. They
                    consider the theoretical
                    case for community-driven development and case studies of success in both sectoral and multisectoral
                    programs.</p>
